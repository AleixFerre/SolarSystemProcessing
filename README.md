## Modifications

What I made different here is:
 - Create new lighting
 - Skybox system that you can change.

I added this .blend file because this is what I used to create all the Background Maps.

[Cube2Sphere](https://github.com/Xyene/cube2sphere) original file
 - Blender file that allows you to convert CubeMaps to Spherical Map images.
